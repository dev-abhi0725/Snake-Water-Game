# Snake-Water-Gun-Game

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description:-

This script is a simple console-based game called "Snake-Water-Gun." The game follows the rules where Gun kills Snake, Snake drinks Water, and Water destroys Gun. Players are prompted to input their choice (G for Gun, S for Snake, W for Water), and the computer randomly selects its choice. The outcomes are then determined based on the rules, and points are awarded accordingly.

The code uses the readline-sync library for user input in a Node.js environment. The game continues in a loop until the user decides not to play anymore. At the end of the game, the total scores for the player and the computer are displayed, and the winner or a draw is determined.
